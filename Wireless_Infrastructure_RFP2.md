# Request for Proposal (RFP): Wireless Infrastructure Deployment

---

## 1. About Us

We are AAA-best Company, a growing organization committed to enhancing workplace productivity through the adoption of modern IT infrastructure. As we expand, reliable and secure wireless connectivity has become essential for ensuring seamless communication, collaboration, and access to cloud-based resources.

---

## 2. Project Scope

### Objectives

- **Provide robust wireless coverage throughout the office premises.**  
  Ensure seamless wireless connectivity across all areas of the office, including open workspaces, conference rooms, break areas, storage zones, and entryways. The deployed infrastructure should eliminate dead zones and minimize interference, enabling uninterrupted access to internal applications, cloud services, and VoIP communications.

- **Ensure integration of wireless infrastructure with the existing wired network.**  
  The wireless solution must be fully interoperable with the organization's current wired network infrastructure. This includes support for existing VLAN structures, DHCP, DNS, and Active Directory/LDAP services. Unified management of wired and wireless networks is preferred for operational efficiency.

- **Enhance network performance, security, and manageability.**  
  The system should deliver high throughput, low-latency performance to support real-time applications such as video conferencing and collaborative platforms. Security must be enterprise-grade, including WPA3 encryption, access control, and network segmentation. Centralized monitoring, remote configuration, role-based administration, and automatic updates should be supported for efficient management.

- **Support future scalability and increased user demands.**  
  The architecture should allow for the addition of access points, bandwidth upgrades, and the introduction of future wireless standards (e.g., Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7) without major rework. The network must be capable of accommodating growth in both the number of connected devices and the intensity of bandwidth usage over time.

### Scope of Work

- **Site Survey**: Conduct a professional wireless site survey to determine optimal placement of access points (APs), minimize dead zones, and prevent signal overlap.
- **Installation and Configuration**: Supply, install, and configure enterprise-grade wireless access points that support the latest standards (Wi-Fi 6/6E).
- **Integration**: Seamless integration of wireless network with the existing wired LAN and network services such as DHCP, DNS, and authentication servers.
- **Security Implementation**: Configure advanced wireless security, including WPA3 encryption, MAC address filtering, and optional 802.1X authentication with RADIUS.
- **Monitoring and Management**: Deploy tools for real-time monitoring, performance metrics, user tracking, and access control.
- **Ongoing Maintenance and Support**: Provide documentation, training, and post-deployment technical support including troubleshooting and firmware upgrades.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### Coverage

The wireless solution must ensure full signal coverage across the entire office premises, including:

- Open workspaces
- Private offices
- Conference and meeting rooms
- Reception and waiting areas
- Break rooms, kitchens, and hallways
- Storage or equipment rooms (if applicable)

Signal strength must maintain a minimum of **-65 dBm** or better in all active areas to support real-time voice, video, and collaboration applications. Site survey and heatmap reporting are required to verify this coverage standard prior to final deployment.

### Capacity

The wireless infrastructure must support **at least 200 concurrent users** without performance degradation. This includes:

- Concurrent HD video calls (e.g., Zoom, MS Teams)
- Cloud-based productivity applications (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace)
- File sharing and internal system access

Each access point should be able to handle a minimum of **40–60 simultaneous clients**, depending on placement and frequency band utilization. Load balancing and band steering should be supported to optimize performance.

### Standards Compliance

All wireless access points must fully support:

- Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) standards
- Backward compatibility with 802.11ac/n/a/b/g devices

Preferred features include:

- MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input Multiple Output)
- OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
- BSS Coloring to reduce co-channel interference

Access points should support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands (dual-band minimum), and ideally tri-band if 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) is available.

### Security

The wireless system must enforce modern enterprise-grade security:

- WPA3-Enterprise encryption as the default authentication method
- MAC address filtering to limit unauthorized device access
- Optional 802.1X authentication via RADIUS server integration
- Ability to segment networks by VLAN (e.g., staff vs. guest Wi-Fi)
- Rogue AP detection and mitigation features
- Client isolation capabilities on guest networks

All network security measures must comply with applicable privacy standards (e.g., PIPEDA, GDPR if applicable).

### Monitoring & Management

The solution must include centralized network visibility and control:

- Web-based or cloud-hosted controller interface
- Real-time status dashboards for APs, clients, and traffic
- Logging, alerting, and historical reporting
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for multiple admin levels
- Remote firmware updates and automated patch management
- API access or SNMP support for integration with existing monitoring systems

### Scalability

The wireless infrastructure must be modular and easily expandable:

- New APs can be added without full reconfiguration
- Must support future upgrades to Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 with minimal disruption
- Controller system must be licensed or provisioned to scale with growing user/device counts
- Scalability should extend to bandwidth usage, authentication server capacity, and monitoring/reporting features
